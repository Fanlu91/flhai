# What is Timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a simple yet effective time management technique that involves allotting a fixed, maximum unit of time for an activity in advance and then completing the activity within that time frame.

A timebox always has specific **deadlines** and **goals** associated with it.

With timeboxing, you allocate time periods to put a strict limit on activities you fear would otherwise **take away too much** of your time.

You work on the activity during the **fixed time period** and stop working on it once the time is upâ€”then, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals.

# How to Implement Timeboxing

## Find Suitable Tasks

- Tasks from GTD (Getting Things Done) practice.
- Work on your most difficult tasks first thing in the morning.

## Define Your Goals

When it comes to tasks you lack the motivation to do, making working on said tasks during a timebox a goal in itself can be effective.

- Example: Working on XXX for 10 minutes straight.

## Set the Time

- Never allocate more than 90 minutes in one sitting.
- Break big timeboxes into ones you can tackle in one sitting. It's okay to fail.
- If setting a schedule initially is too difficult, start by recording how you spend your time. This will change your understanding and perception of time significantly.
- Integrate the Pomodoro technique for enhanced time management.

## Work and Assess Your Results

- Make time visual by tracking the time you spend on each task.
- Once your set time is up, stop working immediately and assess.
- If you've reached your goals and milestones, it's time for a reward.

## Claim Your Reward

While this step is optional, keeping it ensures you have something to look forward to after reaching set milestones and completing important timeboxes.

- Take a break, enjoy some snacks and a coke, or treat yourself to something special like a Rolex watch, if affordable and desired.

# Benefits Beyond the Obvious

- Encourages working on tasks with focused intention.
- Helps to overcome perfectionism, as it's challenging to tweak every detail when time is limited.
